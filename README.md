# ReactiveXD
  ReactiveXD is an object oriented reactive programming language with explicit support for distribution and explicit management of time. We argue that a reactive framework with these features facilitates the design, implementation and evolution of modern massively distributed and dynamic applications. 
  
  This project uses XText to implement a compiler for REAL. We use Jbase to generate pure java expressions and statements using the XText framework.
  
  The compiler generates AspectJ and Java code to instrument monitoring in distributed applications.
